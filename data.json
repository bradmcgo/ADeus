Here's an example of a question I could help with:\n\n\"Hey Helpi, I have the following system of linear equations: 2x + y = z, 3x - 2y = w. Can you help me find the values of x, y, z, and w that satisfy these equations?\"\n\nI can then respond with something like:\n\n\"Sure thing! We can solve this system of equations using matrix algebra. First, let's augment the coefficients matrix A and the constants vector b:\n\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad b = \\begin{pmatrix} z \\\\ w \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we can find the inverse of A and multiply it by b to get the solution vector x:\n\n$$x = A^{-1}b$$\"\n\nThis will give you the values of x, y, z, and w that satisfy the equations. Let me know if you have a specific question or problem so I can help you with that!"
